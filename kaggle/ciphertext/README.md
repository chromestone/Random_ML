#20 Newsgroups Ciphertext Challenge

So here's my go at this.

I first tried a simple feed forward neural network. (I tried this shortcut thing mimicking resnet but disclaimer I mixed up concatenation and add (+) woopsy)

Second, I thought about using the inception network. I picked it because it was what came to mind when I thought "most state of the art and included in keras". I was already thinking resnet so inception_resnet_v2.

Then I realized the kaggle kernel wouldn't let me download weights...

Now I'm doing some stuff on google colab.There I ran into a problem where setting trainable affects the model. So I can't load weights into a model with different weights frozen. I could just load the previous architecture and then change it. I decided to do some inception (model-ception) with models inside models. The outer model contains a series of models frozen (pre-trained) except the last which that model's weights that I want to train.
